/**
 * This interface supports different types of tasks. A task must have a name and
 * an expiration date. Any classes that is connected to a task, will
 * automatically implement the task for every student in that task. A student
 * MUST be assigned to a task through a class, but certain students may be
 * removed individually from a task later.
 * <p/>
 * A student may be removed individually from a task calling the
 * <tt>removeStudent</tt> method.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * Any changes to the task will result in calling any listeners registered in
 * the task. A listener will be called when the following events occur:
 * <blockquote>
 * <ul compact>
 * <li>A student is added
 * <li>A student is updated
 * <li>A student is removed
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * <ul>
 * <li>A class is added
 * <li>A class is removed
 * <li>A class is updated
 * </ul>
 * </blockquote>
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * A listener will also be called when the task itself is updated: <blockquote>
 * <ul>
 * <li>The date is changed
 * <li>The name is changed
 * </ul>
 * </blockquote>
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * A task is handed in (meaning the student is finished with the assignment hand
 * delivers the work to the teacher) using a <tt>mode</tt> parameter.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * The hand in date (expiration date) for the task, is only concerned with the
 * day, not minutes or seconds. If a student hands in a task on the same day as
 * the expiration date, that is fine. Any hand ins later than that, will set a
 * flag in the students hand in date telling that the delivery was late.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * The task has several states. The <tt>STATE_OPEN</tt> is the default
 * state, where it is accessible for students handing in work. A task can be in
 * the state of <tt>STATE_EXPIRED</tt>. In this state it is still
 * accessible for hand ins, but the student who hands in late will be flagged by
 * the task. The state <tt>STATE_EXPIRED</tt> will be set automatically by
 * the system, and will be set when the todays date is
 * <code>expirationDate + 1</code>.
